# JUSCR – Clarity is Kindness

## What JUSCR is

A public commons for exploring clarity together.  
A set of tools, frames, and practices that help us notice when understanding improves — and when it doesn’t.  
An open-source (AGPL-3.0) project that belongs to everyone who uses it.

## What JUSCR is not

- Not a product to sell you.  
- Not a cult, coin, or cult-coin.  
- Not a promise of instant enlightenment or guaranteed income.  
- Not a hierarchy — there is no sole leader, mint, or gatekeeper.

## What never changes

- The core remains free, open, and unenclosable forever.  
- Contributions are attributed, but never extracted.  
- Clarity is the prime invariant: anything that reduces clarity for anyone is out of scope.  
- Kindness is structural, not optional.

## How it works right now

We are running a gentle 7-day experiment starting January 1, 2026.  
You are invited to join a cohort, play with simple tools, reflect daily, and see what emerges.  
Some cohorts will explore teaching frames (IRW).  
Some will explore personal clarity.  
All will stay free at the core.

Optional paid layers (specialized toolkits, certified cohorts, legacy support) may appear later — if the community wants them and they don’t harm the commons.

## Stewardship

Current steward: [your name / handle] — here to keep the commons clean, not to own it.  
Future stewardship: distributed, transparent, and revocable if kindness fails.

Clarity is kindness.  
Let’s test that together.

Let us breath it, see it, and be it for all...
So when the illusion of seperation's seams fray apart, we will be ready with the next best stitch... for you, for me, and for all who see kind as the best way to be.
